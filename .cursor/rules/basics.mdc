- Use `pnpm` as package manager.
- The project is structured as a monorepo i.e. a pnpm workspace. The apps are in `apps` folder and re-usable packages are in `packages`.
- Command for running script in a workspace: `pnpm --filter <workspace> <command>`.
- Command for running tests: `pnpm test`.
- The project uses shadcn for building UI so stick to its conventions and design.
- In `apps/web` workspace, create a string first in `apps/web/ui-config/strings.ts` and then import it in the `.tsx` files, instead of using inline strings.
- When working with forms, always use refs to keep the current state of the form's data and use it to enable/disable the form submit button.
