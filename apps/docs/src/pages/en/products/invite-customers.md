You can invite customers to your published products. This comes in handy in certain situations, such as:

- You collect the payments manually (or outside of CourseLit) and want to add customers manually afterward.
- You want to gift a product to a customer.

## Invite a customer

1. From the `Products` section in the dashboard, select your product to open its dashboard.

2. Click on the `Invite a customer` menu item in the actions menu.

3. On the following screen, enter the customer's email address.

4. Optionally, add any tags you want to assign to the user.

> If a user with the same email already exists in the system, the tags you provide here will be added to their existing tags.

5. Click `Invite` to complete the invitation process.

6. That's it! The invited user will receive an email at the email address you provided on this screen.

7. You can invite more users by repeating the same process.

## The invited customer's experience

The invited customer will receive an email stating they have been added to a product and can log in to access it.

Once logged in, they will see the products they have been added to in the `My Content` area. To access this area, they can click on the `My Content` option from the `Session` button on the school's home page.
