A section is a logical grouping of lessons. It helps keep lessons structured and allows for the release of content in phases (called `Drip content`).

## Look and Feel

Here’s how it looks on various parts of the platform.

## Drip a Section

You can release a section on a **specific date** or **after a certain number of days have elapsed since the time a student enrolls**.

If drip configuration is enabled for a section, a student won't be able to access it until it has been "dripped" to them.

### Drip by Date

1. If you want a section to be available to users on a specific date, this is the option you should opt for.

### Drip After a Certain Number of Days Since Enrollment
