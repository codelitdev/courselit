Certificates add significant value to your courses by providing your customers with verifiable credentials they can showcase. CourseLit makes it effortless to issue certificates automatically upon course completion.

Here are the key features of CourseLit certificates:

- A dedicated page for each certificate issued, allowing customers to share a verifiable link on their profiles
- Customizable text and images to make certificates reflect your brand

**Note**: Certificates are only available for `Course` products.

## Overview

Customers will receive a certificate after completing all lessons in a course.

The certificate will be hosted on a dedicated page that can be used to verify the customer's learning achievement.

Here is an example certificate:

    That's it! Your customers will now receive a certificate upon course completion.

    > Previous customers will not receive certificates retroactively, as the certificate generation process is automated.

## Customize the certificate

1. Click on the `Chevron` icon on the far right of the `Certificate Template` subsection under the `Certificates` section to expand it.

## Customer's experience

Upon completing a course, customers will be taken back to the `My content` lobby. On the product card, they will see a badge indicating that a certificate is available.
