CourseLit uses the concept of a `Lesson`. It is very similar to what we generally see in books, i.e., a large piece of information is divided into smaller chunks called lessons.

Similarly, you can break down your course into `Lessons` and group the lessons into [Sections](/en/products/section).

## Sections

Sections are used to group lessons.

## Lessons

A lesson is a container for the actual learning material. CourseLit supports multiple types of lessons, which are as follows.

1. Text

    For sharing textual content.

2. Video

    For sharing video lectures.

3. Audio

    For sharing quick audio recordings.

4. PDF

    For sharing PDF files. The file will be embedded in the lesson.

5. File

    For sharing binary files like a zip file containing an assignment with the students.

6. Embed

    For embedding HTML or iframe based content.

    See the [guide to add an embed](/en/lessons/embed).

7. Quiz

    For quizzing your students. You can create graded and non-graded quizzes.

    See the [guide to add a quiz](/en/lessons/add-quiz).

8. SCORM

    For sharing SCORM packages.

    See the [guide to add a SCORM package](/en/lessons/scorm).

5. Optionally, toggle the `Preview` switch to allow free access to the lesson regardless of the enrollment status of the user.

    This can be a great way to provide a sneak peek into your course.

6. Click `Save lesson`.
