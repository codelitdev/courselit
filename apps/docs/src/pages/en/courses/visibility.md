If you want your product to show up on the `Products` page, you can do that by using the visibility toggle.

By default, your products are `Unlisted` i.e. they do not appear on the `Products` page.

Your audience will always be able to access the product via a direct link, irrespective of the visibility toggle.

## Steps to make your product listed

1. From the `Actions` menu, select `Manage` to open the product's settings.

2. Go to the `Visibility` area.

3. Toggle the switch to make your product visible on the `Products` page.
