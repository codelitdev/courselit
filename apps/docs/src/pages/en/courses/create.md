Before you can start building your course, you need to set up a school. [Follow this guide](/en/schools/create) to get yourself a free account and create a school, if you haven't already.

Once you are signed in using an admin account, go to the dashboard by clicking on the `Dashboard` option from the drop down menu located on the top right corner of your school.

The dashboard looks like the following.

> Both courses and digital downloads are categorized as products and will be shown under the `Products` screen.

## Steps to create an online course

We will create a free course for your audience. You can always make it a paid one once you understand the process.

1. Click on the `New product` button.
2. Set a title and select `Course` from the dropdown. Click continue.

4. Let's add some content in your course. Click on the `Edit content` button to add a lesson to the first section of the course. A section is a collection of lessons.

5. On the `Content` screen, click on the `Add lesson` button to create a new lesson.

6. On the `New Lesson` screen, `Text` lesson type is selected by default. Let's create a text lesson.

    Add the title and the main content of the text lesson. Click `Save lesson`.

Now that we have added some content to the course, it's time to publish. By default, any new product is in the `Draft` state.

7. Go back to the product dashboard by clicking on the product's name in the breadcrumbs.
