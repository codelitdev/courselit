## What is CourseLit?

CourseLit is an **all-in-one suite** for building, selling, and marketing your digital products, such as courses, memberships and digital downloads.

CourseLit was born out of frustration with the exorbitant costs and limitations of traditional course builders and LMS platforms like Teachable, Thinkific, and Podia. That’s why **we offer all essential features—course creation, memberships, website, analytics, email marketing and payment gateways—in a single Pro Plan priced under $20/month**, empowering solo creators like marketing coaches and small businesses like digital agencies with 1-50 employees to scale without financial strain or costly upgrades.

Plus, CourseLit is fully open-source and self-hostable, letting you host your educational empire at zero license cost—only server expenses of $5–$20/month on AWS or DigitalOcean. Our up-to-date documentation and vibrant community (via Discord and GitHub) make this process a breeze, ensuring you own your platform and destiny, free from vendor lock-in.

## Why did we create it?

We are building the **"WordPress of course and membership platforms"**.
