CourseLit is an open-source software and we make sure that hosting it is as easy as possible.

> ️Please give us a star ⭐️ on [GitHub](https://github.com/codelitdev/courselit), so that it reaches more people.

## Why self host?

You should self host CourseLit, if you:

-   want complete control of your data
-   want to host it behind a firewall for internal use

### Self host CourseLit

See [the self hosting guide](/en/self-hosting/self-host).

## Hosted version

If you don't want to self-host, CourseLit's hosted version is available at [CourseLit.app](https://courselit.app). It is managed by the team behind CourseLit. We will take care of everything, just come with your team and content.
