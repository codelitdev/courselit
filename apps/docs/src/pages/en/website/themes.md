CourseLit's Theme Designer is a powerful tool that allows you to customize the look and feel of your learning platform.

Built on top of [shadcn's design system](https://ui.shadcn.com/), it provides a comprehensive set of options to create a unique and professional appearance for your website.

Every theme in CourseLit comes in two flavors - light and dark mode. This ensures your website looks great regardless of the user's system preferences or time of day.

Currently, themes are only applied to the public pages of your school. The dashboard uses the system theme to provide a consistent experience. If you'd like themes to be applied to the dashboard as well, please leave your upvote <a href="https://discord.com/channels/727630561895514212/1379041635811201125" target="_blank">here</a>. The system theme also includes a dark mode.

</details>

Each system theme can be used as-is or customized to match your brand identity.

## Custom Themes

Custom themes are your own creations or modifications of system themes. When you customize a system theme, CourseLit automatically creates a copy of it, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.

To create a custom theme:

1. Select a system theme as your starting point
2. Click the "Edit" button to open the theme editor
3. Make your desired changes
4. To edit the dark mode settings, switch the theme using the moon icon (ðŸŒ™) and make the changes

Your custom themes will appear in the "Custom Themes" section of the theme selector.

> When you edit a theme, CourseLit remembers it and automatically selects it the next time you open the theme editor.

## Previewing a Theme

Click on the theme card to preview it on your school. This will not switch the theme.

## Customizing a Theme

The theme editor gives you complete control over your website's look and feel. To start editing a theme, click on the pencil icon button on the theme's card.

![Edit theme button](/assets/pages/themes/edit-theme-button.png)

#### Understanding the auto save feature

Your theme changes are automatically saved as you work, so you can take your time perfecting the design.

These changes are stored as a draft version of your theme and are only visible while you're actively editing that theme in the theme editor. When you're ready to apply your changes to your live website, simply set the theme as active and click the publish button.

The theme editor offers several categories of customization options:
