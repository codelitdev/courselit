Having a mailing list to sell directly to is a dream of every business, big or small. That's why CourseLit offers a dedicated block that lets you capture emails. It is also a [shared block](/en/pages/blocks#shared-page-blocks).

Following is how it looks on a page.

> WARNING: This is a [shared block](/en/pages/blocks#shared-page-blocks) so any changes to this block are instantaneously published and will be visible on **all pages** of your school.

## How it works

1. Your audience will enter their emails in the text box on the Newsletter signup block.
2. A user is created in your school.
3. The user is automatically signed up for your newsletter.
4. You can see the user in the `Users` section from the dashboard.

Following is an animation that shows the entire flow.
