Banner block is the default block which shows the basic information about the page i.e. on sales page it shows the product's details like its title, description, featured image and pricing and on the homepage it shows your school's details like its name and subtitle.

## Overriding details

By default, the banner block shows the details from your product or school depending upon which type of page it is displayed on.

These details however can be overridden on the block level. Following is how.

1. Click on the banner to reveal its settings.
2. Change the relevant details from the `Basic` section.

## Creating a lead magnet

The banner block can also be used as a lead magnet form. The pricing of your product should be set to `Free email delivery`. Following are the steps.

### Steps

1. Add the `Banner` block on your page (if not already).
