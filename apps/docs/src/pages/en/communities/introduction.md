## What You Can Do

Everything you need to build and run a successful community, without the complexity.

### 📢 Share Content That Matters

Post updates, announcements, and news directly to your community. Use videos, images, and GIFs to keep conversations lively and members coming back.

### 🎁 Give Members More Value

Sweeten the deal by giving new members free access to your best courses when they join. It's like a "welcome bonus" that makes people excited to sign up.

### 🔐 Control Who Joins

Set up your community exactly how you want it. Choose your community name, write a description, and decide whether to auto-approve new members or review each request.

### 👥 Keep Track of Your Members

See who's active, who's paid, and who needs attention. Approve or reject membership requests with a few clicks, and always know where your community stands.

### 🛡️ Keep Things Civil

When members report inappropriate content, you can review and take action quickly. Keep your community a positive place where everyone feels welcome.

### 💰 Set Your Own Price

Make it free, charge monthly, yearly, one-time, or EMI payments. You decide what works best for your community and your members' budgets.
