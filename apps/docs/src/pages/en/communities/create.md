Before you can start building your community, you need to set up a school. [Follow this guide](/en/schools/create) to get yourself a free account and create a school, if you haven't already.

Once you are signed in with an admin account, go to the dashboard by clicking on the `Dashboard` option from the dropdown menu located in the top right corner of your school.

## Steps to create a community

2. Click on the **Communities** option in the left-side navigation area.

    > The community isn’t live yet—you’ll see a red ribbon at the top as a reminder.

7. To make the community live, you must first add a payment plan. Without a payment plan, a community cannot be made live.
