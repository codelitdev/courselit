## Understanding Email Performance Metrics

The analytics dashboard is divided into two main sections that provide comprehensive insights into your email campaign performance.

### Email Performance Section

This section displays key performance indicators (KPIs) that help you understand how your email campaign is performing. Each metric is presented with a question mark icon (?) that provides additional context when hovered over.
