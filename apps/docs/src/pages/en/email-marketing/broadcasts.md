Broadcast emails are typically sent to your entire list or specific segments simultaneously, making them ideal for announcements, promotions, or updates.

> This feature is currently in beta, which means you may encounter bugs. Please report them in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GR4bQsN" target="_blank">Discord</a> group if you run into any issues.

> **Before you start**: If your school is hosted on [courselit.app](https://courselit.app), you need to get approved to send marketing emails. [Request access here](/en/email-marketing/mail-access-request).

## Broadcasts Hub

From the `Dashboard`, go to `Mails` to land on the `Broadcasts` hub. Here, you will see all the broadcasts you have ever worked on.
