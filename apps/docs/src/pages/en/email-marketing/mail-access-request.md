If your school is located on [courselit.app](https://courselit.app), you are required to get approved for accessing the email marketing feature.

We do this to keep the service safe and healthy for everyone.

> If you are self-hosting CourseLit, you do not have to go through this process. All the emailing features are unlocked for you.

## To request access

1. From the `Dashboard`, go to `Mails` to see the following screen.

2. The first step is to set your mailing address. This is required to comply with the [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) act.

Click on the `Go to settings` button and you will be taken to a screen where you can enter your mailing address as shown below. Enter your mailing address and click save.

3. Go back to the `Mails` pane, and now you won't see the warning about the mailing address. Now is the time to enter your reason to have access to the mailing feature.

Fill out the form and hit `Save`.

4. That's it! Your part is done. The team will review your request and approve or ask for further clarification based on your inputs. You will get to see the team's response on the same screen.
