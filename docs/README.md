# A modern LMS for everyone

CourseLit is a [batteries included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_Included) learning management system (aka LMS) for everyone. It is an open source alternative to Teachable, Thinkific, Podia, Teachery, LearnDash and the likes.

It comes pre-equipped with all the basic tools you need to efficiently run and administer your online teaching business. Features include course authoring, student management, payment processing (via Stripe), website builder, custom sales pages and analytics (very limited as of now).

Check out this live example to see what you can build with CourseLit. [Click here](https://codelit.dev).

2. Sign up for a free account to explore the platform with full functionality.
   - Youâ€™ll get a **14-day trial period** with no restrictions.
   - **No credit card required** during the trial.

---

### Option 2: Self-Host CourseLit

If you want full control over your CourseLit instance, you can self-host it by following these steps:

1. **Follow the Self-Hosting Guide**  
   Refer to the [official self-hosting guide](https://docs.courselit.app/en/self-hosting/) for step-by-step instructions.

2. **Quick Deploy with Vercel**  
   You can also deploy CourseLit on Vercel with one click.  
   Click the button below to get started:

   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcodelitdev%2Fcourselit&env=DB_CONNECTION_STRING,AUTH_SECRET,SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL,EMAIL_USER,EMAIL_PASS,EMAIL_HOST,EMAIL_FROM&envDescription=Configuration%20for%20your%20app&project-name=courselit&root-directory=apps%2Fweb&build-command=cd+..%2F+%26%26+NODE_OPTIONS%3D--openssl-legacy-provider+yarn+build)

---

### Option 3: Local Development Setup

Want to contribute or test CourseLit locally? Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the CourseLit repository from GitHub:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codelitdev/courselit.git
   cd courselit

## Development

The project is organised as a [mono-repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). It uses [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) for managing the mono-repo.

To set up the development environment, first clone the project on your local machine and `cd` to its diretory.

Then replace the values in `.env` file located inside the `apps/web` folder with your enviroment's configuration.

Now run the following commands from the root directory of the project.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the packages
yarn build

# Start the app
yarn dev
```

That's it! Now you can dive into the code base.

## Medialit

CourseLit uses [MediaLit](https://medialit.cloud) as its backend for managing media assets. It is a paid service and you need to have an account on it to store your files in the cloud.

If you do not want to use the cloud hosted version, you can roll your own instance. Add the following config to the `.env` file to use your own MediaLit instance.

```sh
MEDIALIT_SERVER=medialit_server_location
```

## Writing your own widget

You can add additional functionality to your application via building your own widgets. Have a look at [this](widgets.md) document.

## Environment variables

Have a look at the [docker-compose.yml](../deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml) file to know what all environment variables are available for you to tweak.
